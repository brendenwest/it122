**Summary**

JavaScript is now widely used for full-stack web development, with Node.js enabling JavaScript server applications and front-end frameworks like React and D3 enabling new and exciting client applications. 
  
This course will cover modern JavaScript technologies, including server-side scripting, automated testing, single-page web applications with MVC structure, package management, and JSON data storage. By quarter's end, students have built a fully-functional client-server application they can showcase.

**Requirements**

Students should have experience with basic web development skills via IT 121 or comparable experience, including:

- HTML & CSS
- JavaScript language syntax
- HTTP request/response methods
- JQuery selectors & methods

Students will perform extensive hands-on development throughout this course and will require;

- A computer onto which they can install software,
- A working internet connection
- A syntax-highlighting text editor
- A https://github.com account

**Note** - https://replit.com/ provides free browser-based development environments.

This course will use a range of online materials as needed, including textbooks available free online through https://libguides.seattlecentral.edu/az.php?a=o such as:

- [Web Development with Node and Express, 2nd Edition](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.spl.org/library/view/web-development-with/9781492053507/), Ethan Brown

Students can access O'Reilly for Education using these steps:

- Select “O’Reilly for Education”

Class Structure and Topics
####
Course instruction will be virtual hybrid with a Zoom session at scheduled class times to review new material, answer questions, and resolve any issues with completing the homework.

Throughout the week, students can reach out to me directly in the SCC tutoring Slack team with questions.

Each week, we'll cover a new topic, building on the previous week's work. We will cover the following topics, although the order and precise list is subject to revision:

- Node.js overview - core modules, http requests, callbacks, package management
- Advanced JS concepts - ES6, higher-order functions, asynchronous operations
- Express web applications - routes, views, and static files
- Templating with EJS
- REST APIs & JSON
- Data storage & retrieval with MongoDB
- React single-page-application (SPA) development
- Unit testing
- TypeScript & package bundling

Each Monday, you'll be given an assignment to exercise that week's topic. Assignments are due by the end-of-day Sunday of that week. Eact assignment will build on previous ones toward a completed final project.

Most of your grade will come from turning in assignments on time and showing that you tried to solve it using your own original work. Your homework should be completely your own: plagiarism and late submissions may incur a grade penalty.

Homework assignments should be submitted in Canvas as links to your github.com repository. You should use a **single repository and branch** throughout the course, with clear a 'commit' message for each assignment completion.

85% of your grade will come from homework and 15% from quizzes.
