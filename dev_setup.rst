###Dev Environment Setup

Students will need a development environment properly configured for full-stack JavaScript development.

*Key setup steps:*

- Install a code-highlighting text editor such as Visual Studio, IntelliJ, Brackets or SublimeText. It's also fine to use an online IDE.
- Install git (https://git-scm.com/downloads) if not already installed
- Install https://www.postman.com/
- Create a https://github.com account and a repository for this class
- Clone your github.com repository to your dev computer, using the git_setup instructions here - https://github.com/brendenwest/itc230/blob/master/git_setup.rst
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v12.x)  if doing development on a personal PC
